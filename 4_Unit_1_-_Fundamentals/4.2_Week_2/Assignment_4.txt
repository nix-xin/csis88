====== Assignment 4 ======

===== Creating a Rogue Server Cert =====

==== Overview ====
	Collisions for hashing algorithms have been more of a theoretical threat, but computing power that could find collisions is getting closer to being a reality.


==== Prerequisites ====
	None for this assignment.


==== References ====
	Cryptography Part1


==== TODO ====
	Using a web browser, navigate to http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/
	Read the paragraphs summarizing the researchers findings. Click the Slides from the 25c3 presentation link and download the PowerPoint presentation, which you use to answer the following questions:

	The researchers collected 30,000 Web site certificates in 2008. How many were signed with MD5?

	What kind of hardware was used to generate the chosen-prefix collision? How much money did the researchers spend on certificates?

	What was the impact of generating a rogue CA certificate? What would this certificate allow someone with malicious intentions to do?

	Which hashing algorithm were CAs forced to use after their signing method was demonstrated as not secure?

	According to the researchers, what’s the only way you can effect change and secure the Internet? What URL can be used to examine the forged certificate?

	You’re done! Submit your work to Canvas in .txt format.
