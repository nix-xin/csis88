===== More Malware Fun =====

==== Overview ====
	Malware has become more and more sophisticated over the years. It has evolved into a very complex creature that can infiltrate any system connected, and in some cases not connected to the Internet. Malware authors needs to continue to beat any defensive layer if they wish to stay ahead of the game. In order to understand how to beat malware, we must first understand what it is.
