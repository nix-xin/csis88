====== Lab 1 ======

===== Remote Access Trojan - Getting A Reverse Shell =====

==== Overview ====
	As we discovered during our discussion on Malware, a Trojan is a program that contains malicious or harmful code inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and cause damage, such as ruining the file allocation table on a hard drive. The objective of this lab is to have you create a RAT with the capability to provide you with a reverse shell so that you can gain access to a remote system.


==== Objectives ====
	Create the RAT payload with msfvenom.
	Upload the RAT via a misconfigured file server.
	Execute the payload as an executable web page.
	Gain a reverse shell to access the remote server.
