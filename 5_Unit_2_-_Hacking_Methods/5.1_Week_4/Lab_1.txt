====== Lab 1 ======

===== (OSINT) Recon-NG =====

==== Overview ====
	Footprinting (reconnaissance) is the very first phase in any penetration assessment. You have to know your target before you attempt to attack it. In this lab, you will only be gathering information about a potential target.
	
	You have been hired by MPC.edu to asses their website. Their CISO is concerned that there may be potential vulnerabilities that they may have over looked while building their web site. Since the information they put on their web site is public domain, it may just be information that is okay and will not damage the school. Use Recon-NG to help you footprint MPC’s web site.

==== Prerequisites ====
	Kali Linux, Recon-NG (software is already installed in Kali)


==== TODO ====
	1. Open your Terminal in Kali and type the following command and hit Enter:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
root@kali# recon-ng
}}}
	

	 You should see a screen similar to the one below.

	2. Create a new Workspace to store all the information you gather from the target system.
	{{./screenshot_2020-02-15-205414.png}}

	Now, take a look at all the information that recon-ng can store in its database. Type the following command to view the schema. NOTE: You are now working in the Workspace you created from the above command.
	
	3. Let’s add a new Domain to our database.

	Take a look at what you entered into the database.

	4. We can add this company and a description to our companies table.

	5. Now, let’s find some interesting information about mpc.edu. We need to apply a recon-ng module and run it. How about we look for emails. The following command will give us a list of modules that can extract different domain information.
	{{./screenshot_2020-02-15-211136.png}}

	Specifically, let’s find any sub domains that are associated with mpc.edu by using Google to harvest any sites. This may be useful later. NOTE: The “show info” command gives you detailed information about a module.

	 Did it find anything interesting? Let’s take a look at the hosts table. 
	{{./screenshot_2020-02-15-211641.png}}

	{{./screenshot_2020-02-15-211715.png}}

	We're making progress!
	
	6. Now, let’s look for any more interesting files.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
[recon-ng][csis88-mpc.edu] > search discovery
[recon-ng][csis88-mpc.edu][interesting_files] > use discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files

Change Directory to  /.recon-ng/workspaces/csis88-mpc.edu

root@kali# cd /.recon-ng/workspaces/csis88-mpc.edu

Do a listing of all the files in here: recon-ng downloaded multiple files that we can later analyze

root@kali# ls -l
}}}
		

	7. Let’s use FullContact's API Search capability to query FullContact profiles looking for MPC personnel. Take a look at this helpfull guide on creating a FullContact account and API: https://github.com/Raikia/Recon-NG-API-Key-Creation/blob/master/README-v4.8.3.md

	8. Once you created your Free account and received your API Key, copy it and add it to your workspace keys.

	9. To get credit for this Lab, upload your workspace to Canvas. Follow these instructions:
	{{./screenshot_2020-02-15-212146.png}}

	10. Navigate to the Canvas Course page and find the Week 4 Lab 1 in the Assignments menu. Upload the tarball you just created from the steps above.
