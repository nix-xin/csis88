====== Lab 3 ======

===== Sniffing Traffic on Remote Hosts Using Wireshark and Tcpdump =====

==== Overview ====
	The ability to capture and analyze packets is an important skill when performing a security assessment or investigating a potential network breach. This lab will demonstrate how to capture and analyze network packets on a remote Linux host.


==== Prereqs ====
	* Kali Linux, Wireshark, and Tcpdump (software is already installed in Kali)
	* Download the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_gIIalOLno8Pg6ynDxfTagWUis7euSgd/view?usp=sharing|zipcracker.sh]] script. This script uses John the Ripper to brute force password protected files.
	* Download the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpMyl8kFBRZsPklO1iLGrndcvl9oFRXf/view?usp=sharing|justwords.txt]] password file. You might need this file later in the lab.
	* Switch your Wireless Access Point to Hackable_Networks
