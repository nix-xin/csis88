====== Lab 3 ======

===== Sniffing Traffic on Remote Hosts Using Wireshark and Tcpdump =====

==== Overview ====
	The ability to capture and analyze packets is an important skill when performing a security assessment or investigating a potential network breach. This lab will demonstrate how to capture and analyze network packets on a remote Linux host.


==== Prereqs ====
	* Kali Linux, Wireshark, and Tcpdump (software is already installed in Kali)
	* Download the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_gIIalOLno8Pg6ynDxfTagWUis7euSgd/view?usp=sharing|zipcracker.sh]] script. This script uses John the Ripper to brute force password protected files.
	* Download the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpMyl8kFBRZsPklO1iLGrndcvl9oFRXf/view?usp=sharing|justwords.txt]] password file. You might need this file later in the lab.
	* Switch your Wireless Access Point to Hackable_Networks


==== TODO ====
	1. Open a Terminal and make a named pipe. Pipes allow separate processes to communicate without having been designed explicitly to work together. Read more on "pipes" at https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2156
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
root@kali# mkfifo /tmp/remote
}}}
	

	2. Now open Wireshark from the command line and have immediately listen on the named pipe you created.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
root@kali# wireshark -k -i /tmp/remote
}}}
	
	
	3. Using **ssh** to execute tcpdump remotely, let's connect to the remote Linux host using a compromised account from the password hashes found in an earlier lab. Specifically, use the "**root**" account .
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
root@kali# ssh 172.16.5.32  "tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w  -  -i eth0 not port 22" > /tmp/remote
}}}
	

	4. Start filtering the packets in Wireshark, only looking for FTP traffic.

	5. Once you notice some FTP traffic from the remote host, let Wireshark capture a few more packets and then stop capturing traffic. Save you packet capture on your Kali desktop.
	6. Find the FTP data that the user transferred from the FTP server. You will also need the resource files in the PreReq section above to answer Q2.
	Answer the following questions:
	
			1. What is the username and password that the user entered to access the FTP server?
			2. What is the Flag value inside the data that was transferred by the user?
	
	7. Save your answers in a text file and upload to Canvas. i.e. week6-ftp-sniff.txt

	You're done! Have an awesome week.
