===== Weekly Summary =====

==== Week 1 (1/27) - Intro to Ethical Hacking ====
This week we covered a lot of information. From introductory hacking/penetration testing concepts to performing an actual real world demo. I also gave an overview of various well accepted Cyber Security professional certifications. I hope this class inspires to continue pursuing your education and honing your cyber skills. There is much to learn, and much to keep up with in this industry. Its important to keep an open mind when things arent working out as expected. Like anything in life, when things get tough, try harder...  

==== Week 2 (2/3) - Cryptography Fundamentals ====
We talk about various methods and types of encryption, how it's used to conceal information and how it applies to the CIA Triad. As secure as encryption may sound, it is still vulnerable to brute force attacks and inadequate implementation. We realize that compute power is getting cheaper and may become more of a threat to encryption. Here is a link by Daniel Miessler on [[https://danielmiessler.com/study/encoding-encryption-hashing-obfuscation/|Encoding vs. Encryption vs. Hashing vs. Obfuscation]] that will help put some things into perspective going into this week.
