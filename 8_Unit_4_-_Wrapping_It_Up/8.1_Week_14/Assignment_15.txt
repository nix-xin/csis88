===== Indetifying New Computers Viruses and Worms =====

==== Overview ====
	Examine some current computer virus threats.
	

==== Description ====
	As a security professional, you must keep abreast of the many new viruses and worms that might attack networks and computers. If one computer is compromised, all computers in the network could be compromised. Many firewalls dont detect malware attached to an executable program or a macro virus, so security professionals need to train users on the dangers of installing software, including games, screen savers, on a computer.
