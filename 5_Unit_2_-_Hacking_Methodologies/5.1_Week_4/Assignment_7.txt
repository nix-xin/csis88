====== Assignment 7 ======

===== Scan and Deliver =====

==== Overview ====
	A small utility in an unnamed locale has a small SCADA test environment setup. The staff at this utility have installed a DSL line to enable remote access to this system. Unfortunately, the utility staff did not adequately consider the security implications of doing this, leaving the test environment open to attack from the internet.
	
	After experiencing odd behavior on this system, the lead engineer began looking at system logs and network traffic in an attempt to troubleshoot the issue. He discovered what appeared to be unauthorized access into the system. You have been called in to examine this evidence and help determine what has occurred.
