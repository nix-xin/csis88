====== Assignment 13 ======

===== Developing a Security Testing Tool - Bash Scanner =====

==== Overview ====
	Write an interactive Bash script that will allow you scan a local network for active hosts, save the IP addresses to a file, and display them in the terminal window. 
	Automate simple tasks using the Bash Shell. Pentesting made easy. 
	
	Bash is a scripting language that comes with most Linux distributions. It is ideal for automating all of your security needs using the Command Line Interface.

	A great Bash Guide for Beginners can be found here: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/


==== Prerequisites ====
	Go through this week's slides for a refresher on simple bash syntax or review the Bash Guide link provided above.

	1. Download the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BixQCPoRUudQrI_1GfYDGvdawEG6DqoB/view?usp=sharing|scanner-shell.sh program here]]. This is only a template with all of the functions required.
	2. Your task is to fill in each function with the appropriate bash syntax to properly execute the program.
	3. Remember to document your code and test frequently. It will benefit you in the long run, when you need to come back to it and make any changes.
	
	I’ve already tested and formed the syntax for the commands that you will need. All you have to do is read the comments in the code and figure 
	where to place the commands.
	
	For example, there is a function called arpscan(). Somewhere in the block of code it expects the arp-scan command, that’s where your programming
	skills come into play.

| Required Function | Required Command                                                                                                                                                                |
|:------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| arpscan()         | arp-scan --interface=$interface $range \\\| egrep -v '(arp-scan\\\|Interface\\\|packets\\\|Polycom)' \\\| awk '{print $1}' \\\| $sip \\\| sed '/^$/d' >$home/data/hosts-arp.txt |
| pingSweep()       | nmap -sn -PS -PE --stats-every 10s -iL $location > tmp                                                                                                                          |
| pingSweep()       | nmap -sn -PS -PE --stats-every 10s $manual > tmp                                                                                                                                |
| error()           | Requires some notice to user of invalid choice or entry.                                                                                                                        |
| showlist()        | Find a command that displays the contents of a file and the path to that file.                                                                                                  |
